# P10 Data Extraction

Data entry is an important task in many organizations, as it provides the foundation for analysis, reporting, and decision making. However, manual data entry can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and often requires a significant amount of resources. 

A solution can be to automate the data entry process:

P10 is a monthly field book weather stations use to record variables like, temperature, rainfall, pressure, winds, clouds.. These are usefull data for understanding the climate of the area.

## Issue
There are field books from around the 1900s from multiple stations that needs to be digitized. This can be exausting especially if you have other daily tasks to work on.

## Way around this
Coding a python script to extract written data from the P10 field books is one option for the lazy people, programmers.
